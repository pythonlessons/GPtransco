Juan: Hey, Fidel, I'm sorry, this is Juan. I'm done with the truck.

Fidel: Okay, perfect, perfect. What time is my truck going to kick in tomorrow?

Juan: Let me see real quick. For tomorrow it says open window, actually. Let me double check that real quick, Fidel. I have an 8 a.m. appointment time for the delivery.

Fidel: On Wednesday?

Juan: On Wednesday, yes, sir.

Fidel: Alright. But it's a 24-7 facility, so if you have any trouble on the route, just give me a call so we can fix it, okay?

Juan: Yeah, I'm not leaving until tomorrow. I'm out of time, so I just use PC out here?

Fidel: No, it's fine, it's fine. Are you at HQ, right?

Juan: Yeah, I'm out of time, so...

Fidel: No, it's fine, you can sit down at headquarters. So I roll with YARMUV? Do I use YARMUV?

Juan: Oh, yeah, YARMUV, it's okay, it's fine.

Fidel: Okay, yeah, and you can also take the 15 minutes for the post-trip. It won't count like a violation, so you can take the 15 minutes for the post-trip.

Juan: Oh, I can use it with the YARMUV?

Fidel: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Once you use the YARMUV and park, you can put yourself on non-duty for the post-trip.

Juan: Post-trip?

Fidel: Yes, sir. It is get out of YARMUV to on-duty?

Juan: Exactly, yeah. Just before you end with the YARMUV, put yourself on duty, make the post-trip, and then sleep-prepared or off-duty.

Fidel: Alright, sleep-prepared. 

Juan: Yeah.

Fidel: Alright, then.

Juan: Alright, thank you.

Fidel: Okay, bye-bye.

Juan: Alright. Bye.
