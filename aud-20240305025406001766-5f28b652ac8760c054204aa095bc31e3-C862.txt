For tomorrow it says open window, actually. Let me double check that real quick, Fidel. I have an 8 a.m. appointment time for the delivery. On Wednesday? On Wednesday, yes, sir. Alright. Yeah, yeah. But it's a 24-7 facility, so if you have any trouble on the route, just give me a call so we can fix it, okay? Yeah, I'm not leaving until tomorrow. I'm out of time, so I just use PC out here? No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine. Are you at HQ, right? Yeah, I'm out of time, so... No, it's fine, you can sit down at headquarters. So I roll with YARMUV? Do I use YARMUV? Oh, yeah, YARMUV, it's okay, it's fine. Okay, yeah, and you can also take the 15 minutes for the post-trip. It won't count like a violation, so you can take the 15 minutes for the post-trip. Oh, I can use it with the YARMUV? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Once you use the YARMUV and park, you can put yourself on non-duty for the post-trip. Post-trip? Yes, sir. It is get out of YARMUV to on-duty?
